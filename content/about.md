# Rushton Electronics

Rushton Electronics Ltd was founded in 2018 by Dr Joseph Rushton to provide electronics design consultancy services to the manufacturing and oil and gas industry.

Joseph's recent work includes the imaging system for a lunar rover concept and projects for Formula 1 racing.

Our work centres around sensing in harsh environments. We are always looking for new and challenging projects.

We offer radiation testing services (generally for space related testing).

We also supply design and consulting services for custom imaging systems/cameras, image sensor characterisation and we are developing a range of space-qualified cameras.

Our office is in Surrey, UK.

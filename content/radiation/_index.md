# Radiation testing

## Radiation campaigns:

- TID effects with ionising radiation e.g. gamma
- Displacement damage effects e.g. protons
- Single event effects (SEU, SEL) e.g. heavy ions

## For all tests we can provide:

- Electronic assemblies to run the DUT
- Shielding and mechanical mounting for the beamline
- Software and test scripts to simulate use cases
- Automated logging of register corruption, interface failures etc.
- Dosimetry
- Temperature control or monitoring
- Adaptive test plans based on live results
- Full test report

## For image sensors we also offer

- Pre- and post- characterisation

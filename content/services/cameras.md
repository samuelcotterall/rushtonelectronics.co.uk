- Sockets or breakout boards for easy swapping of devices
- Maximum flexibility for clocking, power and readout options
- Software, drivers and integration with test scripts

## Space cameras:

- Any image sensor
- Vibration, vacuum, temperature and radiation testing
- Support for interfaces including SpaceWire, I2C, SPI
- Design for complex mechanical constraints
- Advice on optics
